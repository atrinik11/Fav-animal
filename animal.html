        <h1>My Favorite Animal:Horses</h1>

        <p>Horses are creatures of beauty. Beauty may be in the eyes of the beholder, but horses have inspired artists and poets through the ages. 
            I am awed by the sight of a herd of horses galloping through a field - powerful, independent beasts but stunning to view.
         They are living art forms that remind us of the natural wonders of the world. This in turn inspires us to live our lives at a higher level.</p>

        <p>he Przewalskiâ€™s horse is the only truly wild horse species still in existence. The only wild population is in Mongolia. There are however
              numerous populations across the world of feral horses e.g. mustangs in North America.
                Horses use their ears, eyes and nostrils to express their mood. They also communicate their feelings through facial expressions.
                It is extremely unlikely to see all horses in a herd lying down simultaneously. This is because at least one horse will stand as a 
                look-out in order to be able to alert the others of any potential dangers.</p>
        <p>Horses have near 360 degree vision. They do however have blind spots directly in front and behind them. It is extremely dangerous to 
                stand behind a horse as they are liable to kick out if they get scared by anything as kicking out is their way of defending themselves.
                Horses use a range of different vocalisations to communicate. Whinnying and neighing sounds are elicited when horses meet or leave each 
                other. Stallions (adult male horses) perform loud roars as mating calls, and all horses will use snorts to alert others of potential danger.
                 Mares (adult female horses) use deep smooth sounds, whickering, when they are nursing a foal (infant horse).</p>
        <p>Horses and other equines have better senses of smell and hearing than humans. Their ears can turn in different directions to aid their hearing.
                Horses are undeniably clever animals. Beyond being proficient at relatively simple learning tasks, they are also recognised as having the capacity
                 to solve advanced cognitive challenges involving categorisation learning and a degree of concept formation.</p>
